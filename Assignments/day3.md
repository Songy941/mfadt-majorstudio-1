# Day 3 - About New York City

## Inspiration

I have been thinking of a way to represent NYC in my point of view since I've been here.
I decided to make a video that focuses on the transportation and movements in this city to show how New York looks like in my eyes.

The people, cars, music, rain water and pigeon all represent the lives in New York. Adding them together help me to create a fuller vision of NYC.
