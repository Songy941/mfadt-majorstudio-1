#4D Alarm bed and alarm for time

Developing from my 3D project of the bed, I gave up the idea of imitating disasters.

I added time element so that the bed will now wake you up based on your sleeping conditions and make adjustments itself according to your behaviors.

However, the more I work on this concept the less interesting I found it is. 

Luckily, while I was preparing my slides the day before the presentation, I realize how often I pick up my phone and check out random videos on Facebook and Instagram.

I then got the idea to create an 'app' - like setting so that the apps you want to ban yourself using can actually be blocked on your phone and there is no way other than waiting for the ban period to pass to reuse those apps.
