# 2D & 3D Information and getting up
In this project, I got inspiration from thinking about how to link news with the process of getting up.

I developed the concept of a bed which can imitate disasters like earthquake and fire according to such information from the news.

The problem I worry about the most is people can be offenced by this bed because others' first reaction is to laugh, including myself.
